# 3D Sound Rendering System

3D sound systems are of great advancement nowadays. 
Several corporate and university research projects are going on to measure HRTF and utilize it for digital filtering applications. 
There is a huge role of Digital Signal Processing in Virtual Surround Sound. 
The generation of 3-D sound requires HRTF. 
This project aims at the basics of sound localization to produce a 3-D sound by using some of the filtering concepts of DSP. 
A sound moving source in horizontal plane as well as vertical plane is implemented using both time and frequency domain. 
HRIR filter is designed using basic synthetic model of HRTFs. 
The concepts related to filter design are discussed and mathematical modelling is presented.
